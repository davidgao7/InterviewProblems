# Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the
# given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.
#
#  Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
#
#
#  Search for a node to remove.
#  If the node is found, delete the node.
#
#
#
#  Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
# Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
# Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and
# delete it.
# One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
# Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's
# also accepted.
#
#
#
#  Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
# Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
# Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
#
#
#  Example 3:
#
#
# Input: root = [], key = 0
# Output: []
#
#
#
#  Constraints:
#
#
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10‚Å¥].
#  -10‚Åµ <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ
#  Each node has a unique value.
#  root is a valid binary search tree.
#  -10‚Åµ <= key <= 10‚Åµ
#
#
#
#  Follow up: Could you solve it with time complexity O(height of tree)?
