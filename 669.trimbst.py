# Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries
# as low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in [low, high].
# Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that
# will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant).
# It can be proven that there is a unique answer.
#
#  Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may
# change depending on the given bounds.
#
#
#  Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2
# Output: [1,null,2]
#
#
#  Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1], low = 1, high = 3
# Output: [3,2,null,1]
#
#
#
#  Constraints:
#
#
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥].
#  0 <= Node.val <= 10‚Å¥
#  The value of each node in the tree is unique.
#  root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
#  0 <= low <= high <= 10‚Å¥
