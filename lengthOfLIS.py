Longest Increasing Subsequence
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the given sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "cat" is a subsequence of "crabt".
Example 1:

Input: nums = [9,1,4,2,3,3,7]

Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [1,2,3,7], which has a length of 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,1,3,2,3]

Output: 4
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000

    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: list[int]) -> int:

        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] < nums[j]:
                    LIS[i] = max(LIS[i], 1 + LIS[j])

        return max(LIS)
