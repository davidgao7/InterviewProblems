# Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the
# mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in it.
#
#  If the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order.
#
#  Assume a BST is defined as follows:
#
#
#  The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal
# to the node's key.
#  The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or
# equal to the node's key.
#  Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
#
#
#
#  Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [1,null,2,2]
# Output: [2]
#
#
#  Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [0]
# Output: [0]
#
#
#
#  Constraints:
#
#
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10‚Å¥].
#  -10‚Åµ <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ
#
#
#
# Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the
# implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).
