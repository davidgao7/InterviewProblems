# Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
#
#  The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the
# root node down to the nearest leaf node.
#
#  Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
#
#
#  Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# Output: 2
#
#
#  Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
# Output: 5
#
#
#
#  Constraints:
#
#
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10‚Åµ].
#  -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
