# Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes'
# values.
#
#  Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal.
# Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)
#
#
#  Example 1:
#
#
#
#
# Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
# Output: [1,3,5,6,2,4]
#
#
#  Example 2:
#
#
#
#
# Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,
# null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
# Output: [1,2,3,6,7,11,14,4,8,12,5,9,13,10]
#
#
#
#  Constraints:
#
#
#  The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10‚Å¥].
#  0 <= Node.val <= 10‚Å¥
#  The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.
#
#
#
#  Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
