# Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If
# there is no cycle, return null.
#
#  There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can
# be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is
# used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0
# -indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a
# parameter.
#
#  Do not modify the linked list.
#
#
#  Example 1:
#
#
# Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
# Output: tail connects to node index 1
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
# second node.
#
#
#  Example 2:
#

# Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
# Output: tail connects to node index 0
# Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the
# first node.
#
#
#  Example 3:
#
#
# Input: head = [1], pos = -1
# Output: no cycle
# Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
#
#
#
#  Constraints:
#
#
#  The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10‚Å¥].
#  -10‚Åµ <= Node.val <= 10‚Åµ
#  pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
#
#
#
#  Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?
